This is a design for a shipment dashboard, which shows the status of the respective shipments in a timeline and also filters the shipments which are required accordingly. eg: Delivered, Not Delivered etc.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### [](https://github.com/devRD/Shipment-Dashboard#yarn-start)`yarn start` or `npm start`

It will run the app in the development mode.  
Open  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)  to view it in the browser.


#### [](https://github.com/devRD/Shipment-Dashboard#yarn-test)`yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about  [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)  for more information.

#### [](https://github.com/devRD/Shipment-Dashboard#yarn-build)`yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the  `build`  folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


This project was bootstrapped with  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
